# K-Means Clustering - Custom Implementation

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed, step-by-step custom implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. The notebook uses the Boston housing dataset to demonstrate the algorithm's application to real-world data. This hands-on approach helps in understanding the internal workings of K-Means clustering, including various initialization strategies and their impact on clustering results.

## Objectives
- Implement K-Means from scratch: Build the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python without relying on high-level library functions.
- Explore centroid initialization methods: Examine how different methods ('random' and 'farthest') affect the clustering outcomes.
- Visualize clustering results: Use 3D plots to visualize how data is segmented into clusters.
  
## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Normalize and standardize the Boston housing dataset to prepare it for clustering.
- Centroid Initialization: Implement and compare two strategiesâ€”random and the farthest point.
- K-Means Clustering: Detailed implementation including cluster assignment and centroid updating.
- Evaluation: Analyze the clustering performance using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
  
## Usage
- Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed along with the libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and sklearn.
- Execution: Run the notebook cell-by-cell to observe each step in the K-Means clustering process from initialization to visualization.
